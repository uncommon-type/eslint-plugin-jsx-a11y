## Ways to contribute

There are various ways to get involved, here are a few suggestions of things we'd love some help with.

#### Resolving existing issues

 You can consider helping out with [issues](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) already requiring attention.

#### Reporting issues

If you run into problems while using `{project_name}`, you can report them by opening a new issue and providing as much context as you can about what you're running into, along with a failing test or code sample to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue.

> **Note:** Before filing an issue, please check both open and closed issues to see if the problem has already been reported.

#### Documentation

We are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.
